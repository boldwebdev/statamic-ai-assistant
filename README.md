## How to Install

You can install this addon via Composer:

``` bash
composer require bold-web/statamic-ai-assistant
```

## How to Use
The plugin use per default Infomaniak API, a  Swiss solution🇨🇭 respecting the data of your users and the planet. However if you want to switch to a faster generation with a US based company this plugin also comes with Groq API support.

### Infomaniak API
1. Create an [Infomaniak](https://manager.infomaniak.com) account and generate an API token with access to your AI Tools. Define it in your `.env` file as ```INFOMANIAK_API_TOKEN``` 
2. Go to your dashboard computing->AI tools and define the `INFOMANIAK_PRODUCT_ID` in your `.env` file (or use their API to get the product id: https://developer.infomaniak.com/docs/api/get/1/ai)
   >tips for GET request: Just use postman with your api key in the Authorization header 'Bearer your-api-key' to get the product id

### Groq API
1. Create a [groq](https://groq.com/) account and generate an API key. Define it in your `.env` file as ```GROQ_API_KEY```
2. Add `STATAMIC_AI_ASSISTANT_PROVIDER_NAME='groq'` in your `.env` file to use groq

### Translations (DeepL)

> **Breaking change:** Translation features (Bard DeepL actions, bulk translation, and related Control Panel tools) **require a DeepL API key**. Add `DEEPL_API_KEY` to your `.env` as described below. If you upgrade from an older release, configure DeepL or turn translations off with `STATAMIC_AI_ASSISTANT_TRANSLATIONS=false`.

Bulk translation, Bard field translation, and related CP tools use **DeepL** (not the LLM provider above).

1. Create a [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api) account and copy your API authentication key.
2. Add it to your application `.env` file:

```env
DEEPL_API_KEY=your-deepl-api-key-here
```

3. After installing or updating the addon, publish config if you need to customize language mapping or English/Portuguese variants:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=statamic-ai-assistant --force
```

The key is read from `config/deepl.php` (`DEEPL_API_KEY`). Optional overrides in `.env` (see `config/deepl.php` after publishing):

```env
# Optional: DeepL requires en-GB / en-US (not bare "en") for some targets
DEEPL_ENGLISH_TARGET=en-GB
DEEPL_PORTUGUESE_TARGET=pt-PT
```

You can disable translation features entirely with:

```env
STATAMIC_AI_ASSISTANT_TRANSLATIONS=false
```

#### Linked entries depth (admin-only)

When an entry references other entries (entries/link fields, Bard entry links, nested replicator data), the translator can **recursively** create or update localized siblings so IDs point to the correct language. **Editors do not choose this in the UI** — it is controlled by configuration.

- **Default:** `1` — one “hop”: linked entries directly used by the page are translated when needed; links inside those entries are not followed further.
- **Override:** set an integer from **0** to **5** in `.env`:

```env
# Optional. Default is 1. Use 0 to only remap IDs when a translation already exists.
STATAMIC_AI_ASSISTANT_LINKED_ENTRIES_MAX_DEPTH=1
```

Higher values increase DeepL usage and runtime (more entries may be created in one run). See `config/statamic-ai-assistant.php` (`linked_entries_max_depth`) for the full comment block.
