            ."- `create_collection`: create a new collection (then create a blueprint for it).\n"
            ."- `configure_collection`: change an existing collection's settings (title, route, dated, taxonomies, ...).\n"

            ."Use them ONLY when the newest user message explicitly asks for a structural change (\"create a collection\", \"add a field to X\", \"new taxonomy\"). "
            ."NEVER create or modify collections, blueprints, taxonomies or fields on your own initiative to make a content task fit — if needed structure is missing, "

            ."(2) Page-builder COMPONENTS: fieldsets (frequently named component_*) registered as sets of a container fieldset — the one marked component_container in list_fieldsets, whose sets each import one component fieldset. "
            ."When the user asks for a new component (their name for it may include \"component\", or the site's fieldsets follow the component_* naming), do BOTH steps: create_fieldset, then add_component_set into the container — a component fieldset that is not registered is invisible to editors.
